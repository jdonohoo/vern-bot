# Discovery: simple-swag-shop

## Prompt
I want a plan to build a basic nextjs site that looks like a swag store front.
Make sure it's dark theme'd and can be deployed via SST or Vercel.
I want a stripe integration for payment.

The pipeline vern's should focus on building a plan as laid out in the prompt.
The Additional Context is for the Vernhole not the discovery team.

## Additional Context
The VernHole should discuss using Shopify vs Roll our own.
Is this something where we should focus more on the swag and less on the tech?
We are a fully AI enabled shop, so is build vs buy better to build vs dealing with Shopify fees?
Would be nice to understand if there are other competitors to Stripe/Shopify that we should consider.

Or does the Vern council think we should push ahead with a build?
