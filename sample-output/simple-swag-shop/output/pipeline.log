[2026-02-09 01:46:06] === Pipeline started ===
[2026-02-09 01:46:06] Idea: I want a plan to build a basic nextjs site that looks like a swag store front. Make sure it's dark theme'd and can be deployed via SST or Vercel. I want a stripe integration for payment. The pipeline vern's should focus on building a plan as laid out in the prompt. The Additional Context is for the Vernhole not the discovery team. The VernHole should discuss using Shopify vs Roll our own. Is this something where we should focus more on the swag and less on the tech? We are a fully AI enabled shop, so is build vs buy better to build vs dealing with Shopify fees? Would be nice to understand if there are other competitors to Stripe/Shopify that we should consider. Or does the Vern council think we should push ahead with a build?
