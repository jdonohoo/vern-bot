# UX Vern's Take: The Swag Store Nobody Asked The Customer About

Alright, let me put on my empathy hat and walk through this like an actual human being who wants to buy a t-shirt.

---

## First Question: Who Is The User?

Before we talk about Next.js vs Shopify vs SST vs whatever — **who is showing up to buy swag, and what were they doing 30 seconds before they landed here?**

Because the answer changes everything:

- **An employee** clicking a Slack link to grab company merch? They want zero friction. They might not even be "buying" — maybe it's a perk with a credit system.
- **A fan/community member** who saw a link on social media? They're impulse-buying. You have about 8 seconds before they bounce.
- **An event attendee** scanning a QR code at a booth? They're standing up, on their phone, probably on conference WiFi. Every extra tap is a lost sale.

The discovery plan jumps straight to architecture. **Nobody asked the user what they need.** That's a developer solution, not a user solution.

---

## The User Journey (As It Should Be)

Let me sketch this out in words:

### Happy Path (should take under 60 seconds)

1. **Land on the page** → Instantly understand: "This is a store. Here's the stuff. It looks cool."
2. **Browse** → See products in a grid. No categories needed if you have < 20 SKUs. Don't over-organize.
3. **Pick a thing** → Size, color (if applicable). One or two choices max.
4. **Add to cart** → Visual feedback. The cart icon updates. The user *feels* it happened.
5. **Checkout** → Stripe Checkout handles the heavy lifting. Done.
6. **Confirmation** → "Your order is confirmed. Here's what happens next."

That's it. Six steps. If your storefront has more than six steps, you've overbuilt it.

## Where The Discovery Plan Gets It Right

The recommendation to use **Stripe Checkout (hosted)** is 100% correct from a UX perspective. Here's why:

- Users already trust that Stripe checkout screen. They've seen it before. Familiarity reduces anxiety.
- It handles address entry, card validation, error states — all the stuff that's **miserable** to build well from scratch.
- Mobile-optimized out of the box. And I guarantee 60%+ of your swag buyers are on mobile.

The plan also correctly says "the swag is the hero." **Yes.** The best e-commerce UX is when the product sells itself and the interface gets out of the way.

---

## Where The Discovery Plan Misses (From a UX Lens)

### 1. "Dark Theme" Is Not a UX Strategy

The plan says use `zinc-900` and `slate-950`. Cool. But dark theme has real UX pitfalls nobody mentioned:

- **Product photos need careful treatment.** White t-shirts on a dark background? Great. Dark hoodies on a dark background? They disappear. You need consistent product photography with controlled lighting, or your store looks like a void.
- **Accessibility gets harder in dark mode.** Contrast ratios that pass WCAG AA on light backgrounds may fail on dark ones. Have you checked your brand colors against dark surfaces?
- **Form inputs in dark mode are notoriously bad** if not designed carefully. Ghost inputs, invisible focus states, placeholder text that blends into backgrounds. But if you're using Stripe Checkout hosted, this is mostly their problem — another reason to use it.

**My recommendation:** Design the dark theme around the product photography, not the other way around. Shoot your swag first. Then build the palette around what makes the products pop.

### 2. Empty States Are Missing From The Plan

What does the user see when:

- **The store has no products yet?** (Launch day, nothing's uploaded — it happens)
- **A product is sold out?** The plan mentions "real-time stopgap" but doesn't say what the *user* sees. "Out of stock" with no timeline is a dead end. "Back in stock soon — get notified" is a conversion opportunity.
- **The cart is empty?** Don't show a sad empty cart. Show the best-selling product with a nudge.
- **Search returns nothing?** (If you even have search — with < 50 SKUs, you probably shouldn't)

Every empty state is a moment where the user decides to leave or stay. Design them intentionally.

### 3. The Post-Purchase Experience Is An Afterthought

The plan says "Order confirmation messaging" on Day 6-7. That's backwards. **The moment after purchase is the highest-trust moment in the entire journey.** The user just gave you money. What happens next determines whether they come back or warn their friends.

Must-haves:
- **Confirmation page** with clear next steps ("You'll get a shipping email within 2 business days")
- **Confirmation email** that doesn't look like a Stripe default template. Brand it.
- **Shipping notification** when it goes out
- **A way to check order status** without creating an account (email + order number lookup)

If you skip this, you'll get support tickets. Support tickets cost more than a good confirmation flow.

### 4. The Build vs Buy Discussion Ignores The User Entirely

The VernHole debate about Shopify vs roll-your-own is framed as a tech/cost decision. From a UX perspective, the question is different:

**What does the user lose or gain from each option?**

| | Roll Your Own (Next.js + Stripe) | Shopify |
|---|---|---|
| **Brand control** | Total control over every pixel | Theme constraints, Shopify footer |
| **Checkout trust** | Stripe Checkout is trusted | Shopify Checkout is also trusted |
| **Account management** | You'd have to build it | Built-in (but adds friction) |
| **Order tracking** | You'd have to build it | Built-in |
| **Returns/exchanges** | Manual nightmare | Built-in flow |

Here's the UX truth: **the user doesn't care what stack you used.** They care that the shirt fits, it arrived on time, and the return process wasn't a hostage negotiation. Shopify handles the boring-but-critical post-purchase UX out of the box. Rolling your own means you'll skip it "for now" and then never build it.

**My UX recommendation:** Build the storefront in Next.js for brand control. But seriously consider Shopify for order management behind the scenes, or at minimum, plan the post-purchase UX with the same energy as the storefront design. Don't just plan the "buy" — plan the "after buy."

### 5. Mobile-First Isn't Mentioned Once

The entire discovery plan doesn't use the word "mobile." For a swag store that people will likely find via social links, email campaigns, or QR codes — **mobile is probably 70% of your traffic.**

This means:
- Product grid should be 1-2 columns on mobile, not a desktop grid crammed into a small screen
- Touch targets need to be 44px minimum (Apple HIG)
- Size selection should be big tappable buttons, not a tiny dropdown
- Cart should be a slide-out panel, not a separate page (reduce navigation)
- Stripe Checkout on mobile is already good — don't fight it

### 6. The "First 5 Minutes" Problem

Imagine someone lands on your store for the first time. What do they see?

The plan doesn't address:
- **Is there a hero section?** Or do you dump them straight into a product grid?
- **Do they know who you are?** A small brand bar or tagline helps establish trust
- **Is there social proof?** Even a simple "Worn by 500+ people" adds confidence
- **Can they tell the products are real?** Stock photos vs actual product shots is the difference between "I'll buy this" and "this looks sketchy"

The first 5 seconds determine bounce rate. The first 5 minutes determine conversion. Design for both.

## My Revised UX-First Phase Plan

### Phase 0 — Know Your User (Before Anything Else)
- Define your primary buyer persona (employee? fan? event attendee?)
- Decide on 10 or fewer SKUs to launch with (less choice = more conversion)
- Shoot or commission real product photography against a dark background
- Write product descriptions a human would actually read (not SEO filler)

### Phase 1 — Design the Journey, Not the Pages
- Mobile-first wireframe: Landing → Grid → Product → Stripe Checkout → Confirmation
- Design empty states, error states, and sold-out states
- Dark theme palette validated against product photos and WCAG AA contrast
- Loading states for product images (skeleton screens, not spinners)

### Phase 2 — Build the Surface
- Next.js storefront with the dark theme
- Product grid, detail view, cart interaction
- Stripe Checkout integration
- Responsive and accessible from Day 1

### Phase 3 — Build the "After"
- Branded confirmation page and email
- Order status lookup (no account required)
- Clear refund/return policy page (this IS part of UX)
- Webhook handling so orders don't get lost

### Phase 4 — Test With Real Humans
- Watch 3-5 real people try to buy something
- Time them. Where do they pause? Where do they squint?
- Fix the top 3 friction points before launch

## The Shopify vs Build Question (UX Verdict)

Build the storefront. The visual identity matters and Shopify themes won't give you the dark, branded experience you want without fighting the platform.

But **don't rebuild order management, returns, and fulfillment from scratch** unless you genuinely enjoy suffering. Use Stripe for payments, a simple order database, and clear manual processes. Graduate to Shopify or Medusa for backend ops only when the volume demands it.

The user sees the storefront. The user *feels* the post-purchase experience. Build the first. Don't neglect the second.

---

## TL;DR For The Council

The discovery plan is solid on architecture but weak on the human side. It treats "UX and Dark Theme" as a subsection when it should be the thesis. Nobody ever abandoned a purchase because the backend was on Vercel instead of SST. They abandon purchases because the size selector was confusing, the page was slow on their phone, or they didn't trust the checkout.

**Build for the person holding their phone, not the person reading the architecture doc.**

Why did the UX designer break up with the backend developer? Because they kept saying "it works on my machine" but never asked "does it work for my *user*?" The error message just said `RELATIONSHIP_STATUS_500`. Helpful.
