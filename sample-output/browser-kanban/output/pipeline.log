[2026-02-09 02:27:39] Idea: Create a simple browser plugin that is a todo app. Just need the basics with a new | todo | in progress | done. Do a simple kanban board, make it have the option for dark theme / light theme in user preferences. Have the ability to schedule the task with a simple calendar picker for a date ... have an estimate field to estimate the task time. Have color indicators based off if the task is in the future (Green), due wihin a day (Yellow), and if it's overdue (Red). The Todo items should have a basic Title, then when you click in you can type up a description / add links... bonus points if you make it support markdown editor and render the markdown. Additional feature could be a share button that when you click that it gives you the full todo item definition as markdown to send to some one else.
