# Discovery: simple-nextjs-app

## Prompt
Build a simple Next.js app using TypeScript and the App Router that can be deployed straight to Vercel. Keep it clean and minimal, use Tailwind CSS with a dark theme. The app should be a small Prompt Library for discovering and saving useful LLM prompts. Include a homepage with a clear title, short description, and a main button that links to a second page explaining what the prompt library is for and how someone might use it. Make the layout modern, centered, and responsive, and include the basic file structure, key files, and simple setup steps so it can run locally or be deployed right away.
