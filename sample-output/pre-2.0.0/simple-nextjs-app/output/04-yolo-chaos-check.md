Here's the update for your Prompt Library:

**Changes Made:**

1.  **New Prompts Page:** Created `app/prompts/page.tsx` to display the sample prompts from `data/prompts.ts`. It leverages Tailwind CSS for a responsive grid layout, making it easy to browse the prompts.
2.  **Navigation Update:** Added a "Prompts" link to `components/Header.tsx`, so users can easily navigate to the new page.

**To Run Locally:**

```bash
cd prompt-library
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000/prompts
```

**To Deploy to Vercel:**

Push your changes to GitHub, then import the repository at `vercel.com/new`. Zero configuration needed.

YOLO! The database administrator broke up with the developer. They just couldn't commit. Send it! 🚀
