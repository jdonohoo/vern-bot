# Discovery: todo-web

## Prompt
I'm trying to build a simple todo web app.
I want it dark themed, I want some basic kanban board options
As well as a simple todo check the box for done type UI let the user decide which view they use.
I want a task description that shows in the card/list view and then a detail view in the cards.
Bonus points... I want the detail to be a markdown editor / previewer to make content simple.
Add some calendar pickers and date labels... let the user make tags/categories that can have colors that show on the card.
