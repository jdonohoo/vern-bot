[2026-02-09 12:07:56] Idea: I'm trying to build a simple todo web app. I want it dark themed, I want some basic kanban board options. As well as a simple todo check the box for done type UI let the user decide which view they use. I want a task description that shows in the card/list view and then a detail view in the cards. Bonus points... I want the detail to be a markdown editor / previewer to make content simple. Add some calendar pickers and date labels... let the user make tags/categories that can have colors that show on the card. Tech Stack: typescript / react / vite. Hosting: vercel.
