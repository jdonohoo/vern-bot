# UX Vern's Analysis: Prompt Library App

Alright, let me put on my "You Are Not The User" hat and walk through this from the perspective of someone who actually lands on this thing.

## Who Is The User?

Before we talk about file structures and Tailwind configs, let's talk about *humans*.

The user is someone who:
- Just heard about "prompt engineering" and wants to get better at it
- OR is already using ChatGPT/Claude daily and is tired of retyping the same instructions
- They probably got here from a tweet, a blog post, or a Google search
- They have about **8 seconds** of patience before they bounce
- They are NOT a developer. They don't care about your App Router. They care about "can I find a good prompt and use it?"

The plan lists developers, writers, analysts as users. Fine. But the plan then builds a two-page app where **neither page actually shows a single prompt**. That's like opening a library and putting up a sign that says "Libraries Are Great!" with a button that leads to another sign that says "Here's Why Libraries Are Great!"

**Cool architecture. Where are the books?**

## The User Journey (As Planned)

Let me walk through what actually happens:

1. **User arrives at homepage.** They see a title, a short description, and a button.
2. **User clicks the button.** They land on `/about` — a page explaining what a prompt library is.
3. **User thinks:** "Okay... but where are the prompts?"
4. **User looks around.** There's a Home link and an About link in the nav. That's it.
5. **User leaves.**

The user came here to **discover and save prompts**. They got a brochure. That's a developer solution, not a user solution.

## The Five UX Problems I See

### 1. The Empty Library Problem
**The user sees:** "Prompt Library"
**The user expects:** Prompts
**The user gets:** A description of what prompts are

The plan actually acknowledges this — it suggests putting "a small static prompt list on the homepage" as optional. No. This isn't optional. **This IS the product.** Without prompts, you've built a landing page for a thing that doesn't exist yet. Even 5-10 hardcoded example prompts would transform this from "marketing site" to "useful tool."

### 2. The "About" Page Is a Dead End
The primary CTA on the homepage takes you to `/about`. What happens after the user reads the about page? Where do they go? What do they do?

**There is no next action.** The journey dies on page two.

Every page needs to answer: "What does the user do next?" If the answer is "go back," you've failed. The about page should either:
- Link to actual prompts
- Have a "Get Started" action
- Give the user something to DO, not just read

### 3. The Button Label Problem
The plan says "primary CTA button" but never specifies what it says. This matters enormously. If it says:
- "Learn More" → vague, low motivation to click
- "Explore Prompts" → sets an expectation you can't deliver (no prompts exist)
- "How It Works" → honest but uninspiring
- "Browse the Library" → again, there's no library

What does the button say? **This is the most important UX decision in the entire app and it's not addressed.**

### 4. What Happens When This Is Empty?
The plan includes a `data/prompts.ts` file "for future expansion." So right now it's... empty? What does the user see if you eventually add a prompts page but there are no prompts in their category? What if they search and find nothing?

Empty states are part of the experience. The plan doesn't address a single one.

### 5. The "Save" Concept Without Save
The app description says "discovering and **saving** useful LLM prompts." But the MVP has no save functionality. No copy button. No bookmark. No localStorage. Nothing.

If you promise "save" in your value proposition but deliver "read," users feel lied to. Either:
- Remove "saving" from the description until it works
- Add a simple copy-to-clipboard button on day one (it's trivial to implement)

---

## What I'd Change

### Make It Useful On Day One
Include 8-12 static prompts on the homepage, organized by category (Writing, Coding, Analysis, Learning). No database needed — just hardcoded content in `data/prompts.ts`. The user should see value in under 5 seconds.

### Add Copy-to-Clipboard
One button per prompt. One click. Prompt is on their clipboard. Toast notification: "Copied!" This is the minimum viable interaction that makes the app *useful* instead of *informational*.

### Rethink the Information Architecture

| Route | Purpose | User Action |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `/` | Browse prompts, see value immediately | Copy a prompt, scan categories |
| `/about` | For the curious — what is this, who made it | Understand the project, then go back to prompts |

The homepage IS the product. The about page is supporting content, not the primary destination.

### Fix the CTA
The homepage button should say something like **"Browse Prompts"** — and it should scroll down to the prompt list on the same page, OR link to a future `/library` route. Don't send your most engaged users to an informational dead end.

### Add Micro-Interactions That Build Trust
- Hover states on prompt cards that feel tactile
- A subtle "Copied!" confirmation when they grab a prompt
- Smooth scroll behavior
- Focus rings for keyboard users (the plan mentions this — good)

## What The Plan Gets Right

Credit where it's due:

- **Dark theme is the right call** for this audience. People working with LLMs are often in dark-mode everything. This feels native to their workflow.
- **Static rendering** is smart. No loading spinners, no skeleton screens, no "please wait." Instant.
- **The file structure is clean** and appropriate for the scope.
- **Accessibility callouts** (contrast ratios, focus styles, semantic HTML) — yes, all of this. Accessibility isn't a feature, it's a requirement.
- **Future data model** is well-thought-out. The fields make sense.
- **Mobile-first approach** — correct, especially since people often share prompts via mobile links.

## The Risk The Plan Missed

**Cognitive positioning.** Right now this app doesn't know if it's:
- A landing page for a future product
- A content site about prompt engineering
- An actual tool for prompt discovery

Pick one. For an MVP, I'd pick: **"A small, useful collection of curated prompts you can copy and use immediately."** That's a product. That's something people come back to.

## My Revised User Journey

1. **User arrives.** Sees: "Prompt Library — Curated prompts for better AI conversations." Immediately below: a grid of prompt cards organized by category.
2. **User scans categories.** "Oh, there's one for code review. Let me look."
3. **User finds a prompt.** Reads the title and description. Clicks "Copy."
4. **User sees "Copied!" toast.** Pastes it into ChatGPT. It works.
5. **User bookmarks the site.** Comes back next week.

That's a five-step journey from stranger to repeat visitor. No about page required. No tutorial needed. No docs to read.

**Nobody reads the docs. Design for that.**

## Final Verdict

The technical plan is solid. The architecture is appropriate. The stack choices are correct. But the UX is a brochure for a product that doesn't ship on page one. Show the prompts. Let people copy them. Make it useful in 5 seconds. Everything else is decoration.

The best two-page app in the world still loses to a one-page app that actually does something.

*Why did the UX designer break up with the developer? Because they kept saying "it works on my machine" but never asked "does it work for the user?" Then the 404 page said "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND." Very healing.*
